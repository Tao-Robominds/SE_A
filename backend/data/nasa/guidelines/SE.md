The Systems Engineering (SE) process at NASA is a systematic, disciplined approach used to engineer and integrate NASA's systems. It involves a structured framework of technical processes that are applied throughout the project life cycle to ensure that products meet stakeholder needs, are safe, and achieve mission success.

### Key Components of NASA's SE Process:

1. **Framework and SE Management Plan (SEMP):** The SE process is guided by a Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP), which defines the technical approach, processes, roles, responsibilities, and interfaces. The SEMP is a living document updated throughout the project life cycle to reflect changes in scope and technical development.

2. **Common Technical Processes:** NASA's SE framework consists of 17 common technical processes, grouped into three major categories:
   - **System Design Processes:** These include Stakeholder Expectations Definition, Technical Requirements Definition, Logical Decomposition, and Design Solution Definition.
   - **Product Realization Processes:** These involve Product Implementation, Integration, Verification, Validation, and Transition.
   - **Technical Management Processes:** These cover planning, requirements management, interface management, risk management, configuration management, data management, assessment, and decision analysis.

3. **Life Cycle Phases and Reviews:** The SE process is applied across different life cycle phases of a project, including Formulation, Implementation, and Operations. Each phase has specific technical reviews (e.g., Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review) to assess readiness and validate progress against stakeholder requirements and objectives.

4. **Integration with Program Management:** SE processes are closely integrated with NASA's program management requirements, ensuring alignment between technical and programmatic aspects.

5. **Tailoring and Flexibility:** The SE processes can be tailored based on project size, complexity, and acceptable risk, allowing for flexibility while maintaining consistency across NASA projects.

This approach enables NASA to manage the increasing complexity of its missions, ensuring that systems are developed safely, efficiently, and effectively to meet mission goals.
