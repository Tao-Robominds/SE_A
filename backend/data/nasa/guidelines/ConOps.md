### Key Tips for Creating a ConOps Document:
- **Focus on the User Perspective**: The ConOps should clearly articulate how the system will be used by its operators and stakeholders, emphasizing their needs and expectations.
- **Use Clear, Non-Technical Language**: The document should be accessible to a wide audience, including non-technical stakeholders.
- **Incorporate Visuals**: Diagrams, flowcharts, and operational sequence diagrams can help convey complex scenarios and interfaces.
- **Iterate with Stakeholders**: Engage with stakeholders throughout the creation of the ConOps to ensure it accurately reflects their needs and the intended use of the system.
